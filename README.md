arthurvanstrien-dot-nl

Arthurvanstrien-dot-nl is a project to build my own website. On this website, I want to display a few of my hobbies, my interests in technical stuff and projects I made to create an online portfolio. 
This project started by creating a small demonstration code and I had not the intention to make it the real project at the time. But, like some of you might know how that goes, you add a little code, 
you add some more and before you know your small demonstration project is a full-grown project. Because of this, the first commits in this repository are not the project from the beginning but somewhere halfway. 
Just after I refactored, I decided it was time to put it in version control and use the proper tools for it.

This project is custom made for my own website, therefore it might not be useful to copy to build your own. But maybe some things might inspire you and you can freely use them in your own project if you want.

The project is totally client-side and written in HTML, CSS and Javascript (uses Jquery library). This is because I don't intend to create a way for people to comment on my website. 
Therefore I have decided to not use a database. Instead, I chose to put the content of the website in JSON files and load them on the fly. 
There are multiple reasons for this, having a database means it is a little bit more difficult and costs more while hosting. Also, the best way to get data from a server-side database to a Javascript client is getting it from a web-API. Choosing the JSON route means I don't have to build a whole web-API and have a headache securing it properly.

This repo does not include pictures (exception: flag buttons) but does include all HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSON files. The JSON files are included for the structure and make it easier for me to edit the website and keep track of those edits.

Please also take a look at the documentation pages and the future plans/todo page on Github (https://github.com/arthurvanstrien/arthurvanstrien-dot-nl/wiki).
